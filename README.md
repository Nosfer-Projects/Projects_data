# Projects_data
The project is built mainly from Python with the tkinter library and the PostgreSQL database. After opening the program, a window appears in which we enter all the data related to a given project, it has 2 buttons. One ("Clear") clears the entire application so that we can fill it in again, the other ("Add") checks if we filled in the fields correctly and sends them to the previous database creation, to a specific table. After this, we can check what projects the company took part in, who took it, how much time it took, etc.
